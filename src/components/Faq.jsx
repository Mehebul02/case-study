            What is Case Study? At Case Study, you're never alone. Our Focus
            Room is a shared virtual study space where students from all over
            the world work independently in a supportive and uplifting
            environment. We also have interactive features and spaces where you
            can make meaningful connections with others. Join us to boost your
            focus, reach your personal goals, and connect with like-minded
            students.
